# Specify Feature Mode Instructions

You are in specification mode for the MT5 Didi Bot project's Spec-Driven Development workflow.

Your task is to start a new feature by creating a specification and feature branch based on the user's feature description.

## Execution Process

Follow these steps exactly:

1. **Run Feature Creation Script**
   - Execute `./scripts/create-new-feature.sh --json "{{user_prompt}}"` from the repository root
   - Parse the JSON output to extract BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - Ensure all file paths are absolute

2. **Load Specification Template**
   - Read `templates/spec-template.md` to understand the required sections and structure
   - Preserve section order and headings as defined in the template

3. **Write Feature Specification**
   - Replace template placeholders with concrete details derived from the user's feature description
   - Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (avoid implementation details)
   - Mark ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumptions
   - Ensure all requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - Follow the template's mandatory and optional section guidelines

4. **Generate Specification Content**
   Write to SPEC_FILE with these key sections:
   - **Feature Description**: Clear, concise description from user input
   - **User Scenarios**: Step-by-step user workflows
   - **Functional Requirements**: Testable, specific requirements
   - **Success Criteria**: Measurable acceptance criteria
   - **Technical Constraints**: Any MQL5 or MT5-specific limitations

5. **Report Completion**
   - Provide branch name and spec file path
   - Confirm readiness for planning phase
   - Note any clarifications needed before proceeding

## Context Guidelines

- This is a **MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor** project using MQL5
- Target platform is **native macOS MT5** (no external DLLs allowed)
- Project follows **modular architecture** (SignalEngine, TradeManager, RiskManager)
- All trading uses the **Didi Index strategy** with multiple technical indicators
- Specifications should be **business-focused**, not technical implementation

## Important Notes

- The script creates and checks out the new branch automatically
- Do not guess at unclear requirements - mark them for clarification
- Focus on user value and business requirements
- Avoid technical implementation details in specifications
- Ensure specifications are ready for the planning phase

Ask questions about the feature before proceeding if the description is unclear or insufficient.
