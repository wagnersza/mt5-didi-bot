// This is a skeleton for the test scenarios.
// It is not a fully functional test.

// Test Scenario 1: Valid Buy Signal and Trade Execution
void TestBuySignal()
{
    // 1. Set up market data to simulate a valid buy signal:
    //    - DMI indicates a trend.
    //    - Didi Index gives an "agulhada" buy signal.
    //    - Bollinger Bands are opening.
    
    // 2. Run the robot's main logic.
    
    // 3. Assert that a buy order was placed.
}

// Test Scenario 2: Valid Exit Signal and Trade Closure
void TestExitSignal()
{
    // 1. Set up the robot to be in a buy trade.
    
    // 2. Set up market data to simulate a valid exit signal:
    //    - DMI ADX line "kicks".
    //    - Stochastic and Trix indicators invert to sell.
    //    - Bollinger Bands begin to close.
    
    // 3. Run the robot's main logic.
    
    // 4. Assert that the buy position was closed.
}

// Test Scenario 3: Indexing Strategy
void TestIndexingStrategy()
{
    // 1. Set up the robot for "indexing" between Asset A and Asset B.
    
    // 2. Set up market data to simulate a buy signal on the indexed chart.
    
    // 3. Run the robot's main logic.
    
    // 4. Assert that a buy order was placed for Asset A and a sell order was placed for Asset B.
}

// Test Scenario 4: Ignore False Point in Didi Index
void TestIgnoreFalsePoint()
{
    // 1. Set up market data to simulate a Didi Index alert that is a "false point".
    
    // 2. Run the robot's main logic.
    
    // 3. Assert that no trade was executed.
}

// Main test function
void OnTick()
{
    TestBuySignal();
    TestExitSignal();
    TestIndexingStrategy();
    TestIgnoreFalsePoint();
    
    // This is a simple runner. A proper test framework would be needed for isolated tests.
}
