# Feature Specification: MT5 Trading Robot based on Didi Strategy

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-project-will`
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "this project will be a trading robot for metatrader 5..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a trader, I want to deploy an automated trading robot on MetaTrader 5 that strictly follows the Didi indicator strategy, so that I can execute trades with discipline and without emotional interference, based on a predefined set of graphical signals.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the robot is running and monitoring a currency pair, **When** the DMI indicates a trend, the Didi Index gives an "agulhada" buy signal, and Bollinger Bands are opening, **Then** the robot MUST execute a buy order.
2. **Given** the robot is in a buy trade, **When** the DMI ADX line "kicks", the Stochastic and Trix indicators invert to sell, and Bollinger Bands begin to close, **Then** the robot MUST close the buy position.
3. **Given** the robot is configured for "indexing" between Asset A and Asset B, **When** the indexed chart signals a buy, **Then** the robot MUST buy Asset A and sell Asset B with financially equivalent lots.
4. **Given** a Didi Index alert occurs, **When** the breaking line is moving in the same direction as the line it is crossing, **Then** the robot MUST identify this as a false point and NOT execute a trade.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the connection to the broker is lost mid-trade? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How does the system handle partial fills of an order? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- What is the expected behavior during a market flash crash or extreme volatility event? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST execute trades based on the "imbecil" philosophy, strictly adhering to graphical signals without interpretation.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST use the following indicators with their specified roles: DMI, Didi Index, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Trix, IFR, and Candlestick patterns.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST validate trade entry based on the simultaneous confirmation of: DMI (trend), Didi Index (signal), and Bollinger Bands (timing).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST validate trade exit based on the simultaneous confirmation of: DMI (kick), Stochastic (inversion), Trix (inversion), and Bollinger Bands (closing).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST implement a mandatory, automatic stop-loss for every trade. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How is the stop-loss level determined? E.g., fixed pips, based on volatility, or a specific indicator level?]
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow configuration of trading time frames (e.g., 1m, 5m, 15m, 1H, Daily).
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support "indexing" (long/short) strategy, including the calculation of a financial adjustment factor for lot sizes.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST use the default calibration parameters for all indicators as specified in the description.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST allow for optimization by adjusting calibration parameters.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST be able to identify and ignore "false points" in the Didi Index.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST monitor and use Force Numbers and Trend Lines for identifying price targets, support, and resistance. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are these lines/numbers input or calculated by the robot?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Trade**: Represents a single market operation (buy or sell). Attributes: Entry Price, Exit Price, Lot Size, Stop-Loss Level, Take-Profit Level, Status (Open/Closed).
- **IndicatorSignal**: Represents a signal generated by a technical indicator. Attributes: Indicator Name, Signal Type (Buy/Sell/Exit/Trend), Timestamp, Strength.
- **RobotConfiguration**: Represents the settings for the trading robot. Attributes: Time Frame, Asset Pair, Indicator Parameters (Calibrations), Risk Settings (Lot Size, Stop-Loss strategy).
